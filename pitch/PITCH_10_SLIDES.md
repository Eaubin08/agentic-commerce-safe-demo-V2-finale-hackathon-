# Slide 1 — Title
Agentic Commerce, Safely.
AI agents that can pay in USDC — without doing stupid things.

# Slide 2 — Problem
Agents can pay instantly.
But unsafe agents can burn money just as fast.

# Slide 3 — Why This Matters
Agentic commerce without safety is unscalable and unregulatable.

# Slide 4 — Our Idea
Before any USDC payment:
→ Ask: is this action safe?

# Slide 5 — Architecture
Agent → Safety Gate → Arc USDC Settlement

# Slide 6 — Demo Flow
Safe action → Payment
Ambiguous action → Blocked

# Slide 7 — Why Arc + USDC
Deterministic finality.
Predictable fees.
Programmable settlement.

# Slide 8 — Differentiation
Most demos: agent pays.
Our demo: agent *knows when not to pay*.

# Slide 9 — Use Cases
API access
Compute usage
Data marketplaces

# Slide 10 — Vision
Agentic commerce that enterprises and regulators can trust.
